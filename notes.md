If you're building a web app, 
the first step in the OAuth process is to redirect the user to a Dropbox webpage. 
Typically the user takes some action on your site, such as clicking a "Connect to Dropbox" button, 
and your app will need to redirect the user to a particular Dropbox authorization URL.

The Dropbox authorization URL is specific to your app and is composed of 
your app key, redirect URI, response type, and state 
(it looks something like https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...). 
Each of the Dropbox SDKs contains a method that will help you generate this URL when you need it.

https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=gpmr1d1u1j4h2d4&response_type=code

responds with "Enter this code into Oddstream Solitaire to finish the process."
